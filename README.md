# Sunshade
a devlog by Caden.

Sunshade is (Or rather, will be) a game where you are both hunter and the hunted, in a huge, unknown world. Fight for your survival
as you make your way through the harsh landscape, in search of... something, *anything*.

The game will be extremely inspired by Rain World, and if you don't know what thats is, check it out.

I have began learning how to use Unity and to code using C#. This will take a pretty long time to finish learning, so we havent started actually creating the game yet, plus we are still working on concepts and stuff. Also, we now have at least 4 playable characters planned out, and we have finally got ideas for the endings and campaigns of Kitax and Neko.

We have created quite a few playable characters, two of them are named "Kitax" and "Neko."

![Kitax](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109200091/204119355-11a4cbba-c665-43d0-9631-0bd5726ad2ac.png)

Kitax will be the hard mode, with most hostile creatures hating him and some even hunting him down, and Neko will be the easy mode, with an artifact that guides him to his goals. Pretty much all of our other characters are very unfinished as of right now.

We have been wanting some of the areas of the game to look like some of the art of Rain World, because the backgrounds featured in the art look sick, but are often not in that game at all.

One of those are called the "Blood Forest," an overgrown industrial plant with most of the moss turning a reddish-pink color, also filling the air with the same color chemicals, giving everything a red-pink tint.
